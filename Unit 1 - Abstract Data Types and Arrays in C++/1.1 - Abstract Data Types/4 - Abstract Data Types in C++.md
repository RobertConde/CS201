# Abstract Data Types in C++
* Abstract data types are implemented as _structures_ in C and _classes_ in C++.
* The Standard Template Library (STL) is officially part of C++.
* STL continues a natural progression from structures (data only) to classes (data plus operations on that data) to a
library of trusted classes that implement often-needed data/method containers.
* STL is largely data-type agnostic, as they use templates (very useful).


## Intermediate C++
* Introduces the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the fundamental concept of the creation of objects.
* Objects can be thought of as independent self-contained programs that each have their own name, data, logic, and
interact with one another to form an application.
* 3 Pillars of OOP:
  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
